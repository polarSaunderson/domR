# domR

## Overview
The domR package is a series of personal functions that I use in my own project.
These are pretty fundamental functions, and follow my own personal logic of using R.

## Instructions
This package is mainly a personal package, so it is not available on CRAN.
To download this package directly from GitHub, you'll need to use the "devtools" package.
It's easiest to do this within RStudio.

1) Install the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools). 
``` R
install.packages("devtools")
```

2) Load the devtools package:
```R
library(devtools)
```

3) Install domR directly from GitHub.
```R
devtools::install_github("polarSaunderson/domR")
```

4) Load the domR package
```R
library(domR)
```
