# domR v0.1.4

## Overview
`domR` is a personal package for how I approach R. 
This package is mainly intended to help me learn how to write and share packages. 
The functions make sense to me but are very experimental!

## Instructions
This package is mainly a personal package, so it is not available on CRAN.
To download this package directly from GitHub, you'll need to use the "devtools" 
package.
It's easiest to do this within RStudio.

1) Install the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools). 
``` R
install.packages("devtools")
```

2) Load the devtools package:
```R
library(devtools)
```

3) Install domR directly from GitHub.
```R
devtools::install_github("polarSaunderson/domR")
```

4) Load the domR package
```R
library(domR)
```
